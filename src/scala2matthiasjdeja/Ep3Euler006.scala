  * The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
  * 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10&#94;2 = 385
  *
  * The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
  * (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
  *
  * Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
  *
  * Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
